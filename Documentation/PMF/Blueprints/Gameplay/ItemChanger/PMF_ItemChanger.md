# PMF - ItemChanger Documentation

ItemChanger classes are for changing a visual element of a Pavlov item during runtime, you will see specific version for each type and are expected to find a base and work with that, if you need multiple in one, you'll have to manually do that in your child class.

Note: Most items have a Skeletal Mesh. Use this [Workshop Map](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1907062089) to find out what the item you want to change uses.
